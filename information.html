    <h1>David Gurr</h1>
    <p>Visual communication is a powerful tool, yet we see it abused, misused, or wasted so often. I am a firm believer in the fact that design changes our world, for better or for worse. I feel a responsibility to the work I put out into the world, no matter how small the project may appear. My desire is to enrich society and our humanity by utilizing visual communication in a responsible, innovative, and unprecedented manner. If this excites you, as it should, then perhaps we should consider breaking ground on a new visual venture together. Hereâ€™s to a better world; a world filled with businesses, governments, and a populous that understands, respects, and demands a higher quality of design for ourselves and for our children.
