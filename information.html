about: 'Visual communication is a powerful tool, yet so often we see it abused, misused,
  or wasted. I am a firm believer that design changes our world, for better or for
  worse. I feel a responsibility to the work I put out into the world, no matter how
  small the project may appear. My desire is to enrich society and our humanity by
  utilizing visual communication in a responsible, innovative, and unprecedented manner.
  If this excites you, as it should, then perhaps we should consider breaking ground
  on a new visual venture together. Hereâ€™s to a better world; a world filled with
  businesses, governments, and a populous that understands, respects, and demands
  a higher quality of design for ourselves and for our children. '
