Peninsula Coffee is a social enterprise of Place of Hope. They aim to create positive change across South Florida by helping at-risk youth gain valuable work experience in the coffee industry. We developed an abstract logo mark that captured their dedication to positive change and growth. There are many ways to interpret the mark which ensures that it will last for years to come and continue to internalize meaning and brand equity. We then expanded the identity across packaging and collateral. Â
