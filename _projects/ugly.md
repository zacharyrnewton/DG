Ugly is a campaign that I developed to bring awareness to unethical fashion. The design, copywriting, and imagery were juxtaposed in a way that would grab people’s attention and make them uncomfortable. The images multiply over each other and entangle themselves revealing the complex problems we face today with consumerism in a global economy. The poster design harkens to modernism’s heyday which I felt appropriate considering the fact that unethical fashion is a byproduct of modernization on a global scale.
