<p>Change for Change is a fundraising initiative that Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale began in 2010. Their outdated branding was not successfully capturing the attention of quick moving foot traffic and was losing momentum each year. I saw this as an opportunity to reintroduce the initiative with a bold public-facing image. I developed a new brand identity that leveraged the color yellow and I also created posters and banners that combined photography and copy in a way that would encourage action at even the lowest level, “Every penny counts”. The campaign was successful and the branding was widely appreciated among the community.</p>
