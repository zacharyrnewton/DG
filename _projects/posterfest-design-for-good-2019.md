Honored to be one of the finalists for the Design for Good Poster Fest competition put on by AIGA Miami, Wolfsonian–FIU, Florida Department of Health, and Southeastern Printing. Believe it or not, Miami-Dade County has the highest rate of HIV in the country. The goal of this competition was to bring a new awareness to the HIV crisis in our own backyard while providing information on how we can begin to lower that statistic. For my poster, the repetition of “FOR AND“ aims to capture the attention of both the heterosexual and homosexual communities. Weaving through the poster reads: “Did you know that sex toys can transfer HIV? HIV is contracted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an HIV positive partner. Always use a condom before any penetrative sexual activities—including those that involve sex toys. For more information, visit Avert.org.”
